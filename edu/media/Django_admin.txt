The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area 
that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records. 
This can save you a lot of time during development, making it very easy 
to test your models and get a feel for whether you have the right data. 
The admin application can also be useful for managing data in production, 
depending on the type of website.
